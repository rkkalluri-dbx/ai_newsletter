# Dashboard & Visualization Requirements Quality Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, and consistency of dashboard and visualization requirements
**Created**: 2025-11-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist tests the REQUIREMENTS themselves - not implementation behavior. Each item asks whether requirements are complete, clear, measurable, and consistent.

- [ ] CHK004 - Are all Gantt chart interaction types documented (zoom, click, filter)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-3]

- [ ] CHK015 - Is "color-coded by project stage" mapped to specific colors per stage? [Gap, Spec §FR-3.3]
- [ ] CHK016 - Are chart axis labels and units specified for all visualizations? [Gap]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK020 - Are date formats consistent across all dashboard components? [Consistency, Gap]
- [ ] CHK021 - Is the 6-stage lifecycle (Authorized→Construction Ready) consistently referenced in all visualizations? [Consistency, Spec §3 Lifecycle]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK022 - Can "Dashboard displays projects exceeding SLA thresholds" be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §US-1 AC]
- [ ] CHK023 - Can "Interactive Gantt chart showing all active projects" be tested without ambiguity? [Measurability, Spec §US-2 AC]
- [ ] CHK024 - Are vendor performance acceptance criteria testable with specific metrics? [Measurability, Spec §US-4 AC]
- [ ] CHK025 - Is "Trend charts (improving/declining performance)" measurable criteria defined? [Ambiguity, Spec §US-4 AC]
- [ ] CHK026 - Can "Actions ranked by urgency and business impact" be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §US-5 AC]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK027 - Are requirements defined for dashboard with 0 overdue projects? [Coverage, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK028 - Are requirements defined for Gantt chart with 500+ projects (per NFR-1.4)? [Coverage, Spec §NFR-1.4]
- [ ] CHK029 - Are requirements defined for vendor with 0 completed projects (no metrics)? [Coverage, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK030 - Are partial data load scenarios addressed (some API calls fail)? [Coverage, Exception Flow]
- [ ] CHK031 - Are concurrent dashboard refresh scenarios considered? [Coverage, Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements Coverage

- [ ] CHK032 - Is page load time target (<2s) allocated across dashboard components? [NFR Clarity, Spec §NFR-1.1]
- [ ] CHK033 - Is Gantt chart render performance specified for 500+ projects? [NFR Coverage, Spec §NFR-1.4]
- [ ] CHK034 - Are accessibility requirements defined for chart interactions (keyboard navigation)? [NFR Gap, Spec §NFR-4.3]
- [ ] CHK035 - Are color contrast requirements specified for severity indicators (WCAG 2.1 AA)? [NFR Coverage, Spec §NFR-4.3]
- [ ] CHK036 - Are responsive breakpoints defined for dashboard layout? [NFR Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK037 - Is the dependency on pre-calculated vendor_metrics documented? [Dependency, Spec §FR-4.6]
- [ ] CHK038 - Is the assumption that alerts are generated by daily batch job documented? [Assumption, Spec §FR-2.3]
- [ ] CHK039 - Are chart library constraints (gantt-task-react, Recharts) reflected in requirements? [Dependency, Plan §1]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK040 - Is "click-through to project details" behavior specified for all chart elements? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-3.5]
- [ ] CHK041 - Does "ability to mark actions as addressed" conflict with alert acknowledgment flow? [Potential Conflict, Spec §US-5, §FR-2.5]
