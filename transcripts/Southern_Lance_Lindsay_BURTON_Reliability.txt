Did you guys do anything eventful for Halloween this year? At me. I didn't do anything.

Chase kids around the neighborhood. Yeah, it's a little trick or treating action. That's about it. Actually, this is the first year in 16 years. I didn't. I just sat and handed out candy. All the kids were old enough to go do their own thing. So just, uh, we let them go.

There you go. Was that a breath of fresh air you didn't have to chase kids around a neighborhood? It was fun. It was a little, uh, little, uh, I guess, sad, Bittersweet. Yeah, yeah, it was fine. That's nice. Curtner, your your kids walking. They are. They are just figuring it out, so it's.

It's going to be a challenging, but yet exciting times for sure. And twins, right? So they're both going two different directions? Yeah, that's it. Well, good luck. Yeah, trick-or-treating was hard enough for me this year, with one one baby to chase so. Yeah, it's. Like, I said, it's a it never.

Don't know. There'd be 10 million employers on the floor, but they're going two different directions to two different things they don't need to be messing with. So always. Um, well, hey, real quick, Steven, just sent me a message he is running late, so I don't want to waste time, and we can get started.

I'll I'll let Raj actually formally introduce himself since he hasn't met you guys officially so. Um, Raj, do you want to give a quick introduction to the group? Sure, yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Lindsay. Hey, guys, uh, this is Raj and I. My role with Apex is I'm a solutions architect, so I usually going to come in to projects, uh, when customers have needs understand what the needs are.

And try to create like a point of view and how we would solve it as Apex based on previous experiences that Southern and other places. And I kind of specialize in the data and analytics space. And especially with, like more, power bi and reporting and data bricks. And we've been talking to a few folks within Southern, I think, with similar needs.

Hence, I think Steven and Lindsay kind of set up this conversation to see what your needs are and how I can help. I sit in Austin, Texas. I also didn't do much for Halloween, other than just. You know sitting and watching TV and handing out candy to kids? Uh, and yeah, looking forward to this conversation and and see how we can help.

Awesome! Thanks, Raj. And um, just so you guys know. I know when we brought on our three resources to help you guys out with the initial ask and reliability. We were moving really, really quickly, and Gerald really just had expressed he wanted. You know, three resources, and you guys were going to be heavily involved in in the project, and so we didn't really have time to get Raj involved, but I'm actually really excited to have him join the conversation today.

See how we can better understand, uh, the future State gaps and and how we can help you and? Um, just on your journey, so I'm excited to continue the conversations. And, um. You know, I don't know if you guys want to just do super fast introductions on your side, and then we can dive into the opportunity.

Um, is that okay? Do you guys want to go? Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Yeah, okay. Sounds good. So, Gerald Ramsey and the reliability and automation manager here at Georgia Power, and um, basically, my team has responsible for. Um, they're responsible for reliability, reporting, and then creating capital projects to resolve any root causes of outages on the system.

We have the automation team that. Helps troubleshoot and commission our automated smart devices, and then also they have the enhanced power quality team that is, um, responsible for driving noise out the system. As far as you know, voltage problems or just any issues that that's going to affect the quality of the power that we deliver.

I'll turn over the boat. Thanks, Cheryl! So Burton law, here I am, the supervisor for the reliability portion of of Gerald's team and also a portion of the epq team. Uh, here at GPC, uh, been with a company just a little over 10 years now. Um, been all across the state in different roles across distribution.

Um, spent time as a distribution engineer, and then the time as a distribution automation team member that Gerald also mentioned, and then just came to their liability group back in March of this year.

Hey, my name is Lance Boyer. I'm the reliability engineering program manager been with the group since April. Been with the company for about 14 years in varying roles across the across the company. So looking forward to speaking with you today. Thanks guys! I'm not sure who wants to start on your side with a quick kind of overview of the the upcoming opportunities, but um, yeah, I'll kick us all, uh, sounds good.

Yeah, I, you know, Lance, and Burton? They really haven't had a chance to kind of go through it with me. And so, me and Stephen met, uh, on Friday, if I'm not mistaken, and just kind of was discussing just different aspects and different opportunities. And one of the things we were looking into.

And which, you know, I don't need Lance and burden because they're a little bit closer to it, and they know the capabilities of. Pick the analyst that we have, but one of the things I think will help us out is we have a work plan. That we develop, you know?

On a daily basis. We're in that work plan, and it shows our projects that are either in construction or in design. Are in this various steps along the way to get those projects completed. And you know, in the field and completed? And what I thought would be beneficial for the group is, you know, something like you are probably familiar with P6.

I think it's Primavera P6, where it just kind of a scheduling tool to show when we put projects. You know, when we we send them out to our vendors, you know? Maybe that initiates that timeline, and we have these different windows in which we're looking to have those projects return to us.

And so we could develop some type of Gantt chart or just scheduling tools to kind of show us. And you know, quickly identify. Okay, this project has been sent out to a vendor. We haven't received it back yet, you know, just quickly identify those so we can follow back up with that vendor so and so forth.

Maybe even some metrics around. You know, the timeliness of us getting these projects back? Uh, you know, we can keep up with things like that, because that has just kind of help us know. You know which vendors are performing well for us and which ones we may need to, you know?

Provide feedback to. To ensure that we're, you know, we're? Get our deliverables back in a timely man, but that's that's really the the gist of it, you know, as far as what I was looking for, okay? Joe quick question, so are you guys already using P6 to capture some of this?

These sketch schedules and data? No, we're not, uh, we've mainly, uh, use a spreadsheet. I'll try to show it, right, quick? Maybe I'll show dashboard a little bit quicker, let's see. All right. So, yeah, if you want to share, share the the work plan dashboard too. It might be good to get Raja's eyes on that as well.

Just to have a little bit more visibility. I'll share that. Do you mind if I record so he can take a back? Look back at this if he needs to, I don't know. What's that? Sorry, that's. That's. I don't mind. I don't sounds good. Can y'all see my screen?

Yes, so? So, this is our. Free dashboard that we, you know, give everyone access to just so they can have line of sight into the projects that are going on in their area. Um. But this comes from a spreadsheet that Lance and Burton maintains. And so all the information on the dashboard.

There's other fields that we have that are not showing, but you know, you can see some of the dates as far as when it was authorized, and that kind of triggers other things to happen. You know, as far as us, sending things to stores. We have to do some, uh, qaqc reviews on these projects and so forth.

So, my thoughts is just being able to track some of those days, and you know where we can have some Flags to know? Okay, these projects, because you know, it may be a time where we return a project to a vendor to make Corrections. And we have so much going on.

So if you you look? Try to. What else is that? Um, if you look at all the projects we have, so you got 710 projects and Burton and Lance? They're really good, but it's it's tough right for them to keep up with. Bad amount of projects because you know, we may send 20 back to make, have revisions on.

And I would just love love some type of. You know, software programming to kind of help us out in that aspect. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah. So 100%, I hear you there. So, like, basically, you just need better visibility into kind of the whole process flow within the status of each project.

Like to your point if something goes back to the vendor? How do you not lose sight of that. And how do you know that you can hold the vendor accountable to certain slas to getting whatever it is, you ask them to make a correction on back to you in a timely manner.

So, you guys can continue to push these projects through the process. Just better visibility into those types of things. Yeah, that's correct. And Lance Burton, I mean, y'all. Let me know if I'm on track, or is that something you know you? Would like to have any thoughts around that that I may have missed.

They be getting wrong.

No Gerald, you didn't. You didn't miss anything, um? You know, we're started, kind of working on some of that and looking looking into some of the tracking capabilities, but definitely open to some new ideas and thoughts around it. In thanks Lance! And how many vendors do you guys have General Airlines?

I know there's 700 projects, so I'm guessing at the max, you probably have like a couple thousand projects. Or a thousand or so, is that a good number that's total as far as price? Yeah, as far as project, you know, I would say. Going forward. And this year, I think we ended up with 700.

And I could be wrong on that, but that's what's on the workbench. So some of these projects are completed already. So I said 700 next year. I think that number will be either the same or higher. Uh, as far as the number of vendors, you know, that number is growing, too, as we speak.

So, we will probably end up with, you know, upwards to probably 15 vendors. At some, we'll have 15 vendors at some point. Okay, so it's not like a large crowd that you have to maintain. Yeah, it's just the volume of the works. Yep, and what's the? Benefit of kind of this.

Tracking this workflow correctly. Is there a financial impact, or is it more? Um, efficiencies and things like that. What would you guys gain? Yeah, I think is all of it, right? I mean, the financial impacts of not getting, you know, not getting projects into construction. It's a reliability impact.

Is an efficiency impact. This is, you know, it affects the customer experience, right? If we're not getting these projects completed on time. And Things fall through the cracks. Well, you know, that's maybe an outage that we could have prevented. Come to fruition, okay, and it's almost like you need to when you come to the screen.

You need to have. Almost like, okay, these are the next five things you have to follow up with these five vendors. This is the next best actions for you, based on your past experience kind of recommendation. Sounds like is a good place. That way, they can focus on almost like a to-do list.

That's, like, smart, so that they can kind of spend their time. Wisely to see where things are. Yeah, that. That's my my thoughts on it. Okay. Sounds good and you guys are currently looking at things in power bi, and you're probably May in the spreadsheet. How's the data? I guess being made into the report from the spreadsheet, is that just being like put in SharePoint and you have power bi just pulling from it or?

Yeah, so, yeah, go ahead. Sorry, Gerald, I, you, maybe you know the better accurate answer here, but I, I was just going to mention that the the database is now a sequel, on-prem Raj okay, and uh, Power bi is being built. On top of that, I believe, unless you guys have changed in the last couple weeks.

Child, am I wrong there? Yeah, I think you're right. I was gonna and I'm not exactly sure how it's doing. I don't do know there are some sequel, uh, queries tied to it. We are hitting. We have an application that we're getting some of this information from as far as when to when you know how to when something is authorized, so we're getting that it's hitting.

You know, one of our other databases, but um? Unless I know you're involved the the analyst, so you may know a little bit more to that. That aspect, but uh, it's mainly looking at our Jets database and a Sprint.

So does I guess Alliance? Do you like look at the chats database and? Um, kind of, update the spreadsheet with what's happening there, and that flows into the SQL Server. Um, and then that shows up in the reports. Or what's the workflow for the data flow? I'd have to get with David in the seat and Ben to to fully document the workflow.

But yeah, so they're they're running queries into the Jets database to, uh. Automatically populate the spreadsheet. A lot of the spreadsheet information that we're utilizing okay and then bringing it back into Power bi force. Um, those are our Consultants right now, the um, the ones that he had mentioned so we could get more technical with them if we need to sure, sounds good.

Yeah, sounds like, uh, there's definitely a need to. Automate the process a little bit and then. Can I give them meaningful actions to take for the projects that? They can kind of move on and do more. Value, add things. Versus trying to dig through the spreadsheets and other things to figure out what to do.

Yes, so I would say I think we got a good process in place today. I mean. Automated a lot, you know, we don't have to. Do you know, there's? A handful of columns that we have to go in and manually, you know, put data into the spreadsheet. And once we do that, you know, it may be.

We have what we call work order numbers, so once we put that work order number in that spreadsheet, then that's where the magic happens in terms of those queries pulling from the Jets got based on and so forth. So there are a few. Parliament down here. For manual input, but that's very minimal.

Awesome! So I know this is the workflow. But do you have, like, you know, let's say, if we have to like? Uh, reimagine, like how this workflow Works to add a lot of value? Are there other data sets that are useful? They're going to marry with what you guys are doing to make these decisions like, either predict, like, what's going to happen or?

Calculate some forecasts or things like that that you would want to see in if you're building like a brand new system. Something that makes like adds a lot of value for what you guys are doing. I think the biggest thing for me is just the scheduling piece, you know, just?

Line of sight into what projects are out there? You know, what are we waiting on? Ah, okay, yeah to to as to not allow something to fall through the cracks. Yeah, yeah, yeah, something that keeps track. Okay, notifications are something that maybe that can alert people daily or until the result kind of a thing.

So it's like a good good place. Cool. Yeah, I think we could always start with the basic stuff, and once we understand the data, maybe we can get fancy on. Other things. Until then, I think. We'll do some research, uh Gerald and Lance on, like, you know, hey, what's a good fit for these guys?

That we can get there, maybe in a few steps. Troll walk run that will minimize punching into the spreadsheet or maybe even eliminate that and have that kind of come in from a centralized system. And something that does the workflow. Like, you said automation. Uh, and some kind of alerting that makes sure things don't fall to the crack.

So, what happens like you? Yes, pick up a phone and call somebody when you see that a vendor is not responding. For a certain amount of time. Yeah, well, we have. We have bi-weekly meetings with vendors. Okay, so we can, you know, we'll probably just bring that up when we meet with them.

Okay, so that's when this spreadsheet is. This report is going to be useful. When you have the bi-weekly with, is it all of them separately, or is it all one-on-one with those vendors? It's one-on-one, okay, for a different Pro. Yeah, based on whoever is active at that time, I guess.

Sounds good. There's only 15 of them, and you probably have like four or five that you need to meet. On a weekly basis. Yeah, yeah, we've just kind of. Oscillate, that between the different weeks, and you know? Thursdays, or really the day that we meet with the vendors and?

Do as best we can. As far as getting those meeting scheduled and in general, will your? Would you be in favor of more like purchasing something like everywhere that does this for you, or do you want to build something simple that works for you. What would be your preference if you had to pick one or the other?

Yes, great question, I would say. I would say if we could build something that that the team can use that we can maintain going forward like that. I probably want to stay away from, like having to get licenses and things of that nature. Yeah, makes sense, yeah, but remember, from article is super expensive, so it's definitely if you guys already don't have it, then it's going to be like a year-long process to get it.

Even then, it may not make sense for the scale you're talking about. Okay, well, we we'll also have, you know, full-time employees that, you know, our Consultants that will be converting to that can kind of maintain something that is more built in-house, I think so. Sure, um Gerald. Have you guys had any other future conversations around like the roadmap and plan to move to databricks, I know?

That's been a conversation that you've had. Here and there, and it's gotten brought up a few times. And then it wasn't necessarily a priority for this year, but I is it still a conversation or thought on your side. Yes, so we should. I mean, our our data now is in databricks.

If I'm not mistaken, I don't know if Paul, like, from a reliability standpoint of our data is in data bricks, but just overall, like some of the data that we use, that the other groups are using. Yeah, they they have moved to database, okay? Yeah, yeah, I know. I didn't know where where you stood with, like, you know, the majority of the data, but I do know that some other reliability data is definitely, and data bricks so?

Um, that could be something Raj that we could talk about. Maybe it does make sense to look at that as a solution here. Yeah, and talk through that with the guys. Yep, yep, I think, uh, yeah, definitely. We want to like, work through, like, what would a like a workflow and a UI look like?

What would they want like a workshop setting of some sort? Lindsay, like where you craft that and then that can run anywhere our power app or data bricks or XYZ that seems to be the critical part here so that? It makes sense for these guys. Logical workflow and user interface.

Uh, and then we can. The tooling and Technology can be figured out. Uh, database obviously is an option because they already have it, and some data sits there. But there may be other simpler options, uh, for we can decide on that based on what we find out. That sounds good, and you guys have any budget, uh?

Concerns are how much you want to spend on something like this. It doesn't have to be a fixed number like a ballpark. Like, hey, I'm thinking about XYZ that that will tell us sometimes what the solution should look like. Yeah, um, I mean, I don't have a number right off the top of my head, uh.

But yeah, I think it really just depend on the solution that we get. Is, is, you know, kind of dictate how far we want to go with it? Sure, yeah, we can give you some options and tell you, hey, this one cost you 100 Grand. That one's maybe 200, these are the pros and cons.

That way, you can pick and choose. Which way your team wants to go? Yep, that sounds good. Awesome. And I think in the meantime, too, Raj, we can have a kind of a little bit further of a technical conversation with, you know, David and Betsy and get get a little bit deeper with our the Apex Consultants and?

Um, talk a little bit more about the work plan dashboard because they actually built that so. Um, yeah, yeah, you could probably have another deeper conversation with them from a technology standpoint and then Circle back to the guys with. Kind of a Next Step. Um, when would you like to get started on this guys?

I know we're approaching the holidays and end of beer and everything like that. Do you want to do you want to get something going before end of year, or were you thinking beginning of the year at this point? Yeah, I'm okay with trying to get something going this year so we can have it for next year.

Uh, yeah, at least being able to look at the proposal. Yep. Paperworking place. Yeah. Okay, excellent. Yeah, I'd say, you know, we can absolutely get something from a contract standpoint solidified this year and and get started and then hit the ground running. You know, a little bit further in January.

Anything we can do now to get a head start, I think, would be helpful too. So. Um. Okay, awesome. Well, Roush any any other questions for the guys on just that? Or even do you want to see anything else in the work plan dashboard, or we could again, we can have that further conversation with David and besit, but?

You know, I think this is a good starting point. I'll all kind of chew on it a little bit. Ah, do some research on. Like, what are the options they talk to those guys? And then we can come back to General lens, but I think it seems to be pretty straightforward.

They have they want to optimize the workflow. They need a report of some sort to show what spending what's falling through the cracks for their meetings with these vendors. A little bit of details license dice on all these. Projects that are in there, just like they have now, but maybe that's backed by more than a spreadsheet.

The second of versioned and audited sort of size. Somehow, the spreadsheet fell off the face of the Earth. They can still function. Kind of things a little more. Secure Enterprise level reporting. Sounds like I need. Okay. Well, awesome, you guys. I'm glad you're able to meet with Raj, so um, he's the the method behind our our solutioning, for sure.

So Stephen and I can only get you so far, but Raj is super helpful in building these types of, you know, custom applications and solutions for our customers so? Um. Any other thoughts or information you need from us, or we can Circle back, and I can fill Steven in on the conversation and set up the next step.

I think we're good. Great to hear back from you all and welcome there! Okay.
